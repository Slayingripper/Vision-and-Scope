\section{Background}
Even for the most relaxed students, university may be challenging. For many, this is the first time that you live away from family, friends and home comforts, but there are things you can do to keep your worries at bay.Stress is a normal part of life to some extent, it is only when the amount we experience exceeds our ability and resources to manage it that we find ourselves in a vicious stress cycle.Stress is the body's physical and mental response to its demands. It is the result of our response to events outside, not necessarily the events themselves.Students are always looking for a way to relieve stress through different ways.
 
\section{Business Opportunity}
The rise of stress in the work place has given us a large business opportunity to help those in need of stress reduction.Creating a game for stress relief seems like a fantastic business opportunity. Studies have also shown that action-based video games not only reduce stress but can also sharpen cognitive skills such as speed of reaction. This can help gamers think faster on their feet and are likely to be better able to solve problems, which can also \href{https://www.verywellmind.com/active-problem-solving-425384}{reduce stress} in other ways.
